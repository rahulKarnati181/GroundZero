# ZeroApp

Minimal Angular 17 starter generated with `@angular/cli@17.3.8` and trimmed to a blank shell component so you can drop in your own features immediately.

## Getting started

- `npm install` – already run, repeat if you add dependencies.
- `npm start` – serves the app on `http://localhost:4200/` with live reload.
- `npm run build` – production build to `dist/`.

The root component template is intentionally empty and there are no pre-generated specs so the workspace stays clean.
